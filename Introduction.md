**Oliver's Introduction**

Hi everyone! My name is Oliver and I am a new PhD student and TA in the statistics department here at UNL. 
I just moved to Lincoln about a month ago and so far, I'm really liking it! 
I came from central Masssachusetts where I grew up. 
I recently finsihed my undergraduate degree this year at a very small state school known as Fitchburg State Universtiy in Fitchburg, MA. 
I majored in Applied Mathematics and Economics. 
I actually stared my undergraduare as a Computer Science major, but I realized quickly that I had a love for mathematics, so I switched majors. 
Since I was a CS major for a year, I did take some CS courses that covered Python and Java. 
For my Econ major, I took a course in Econometrics where we analyzed economic data using STATA. 
I took a couple of statistics courses as well for the math major and one of those courses went over the basics of R and R Studio. 
I have also used LaTeX in many of the math courses that I took at Fitchburg. 
I also learned how to use a software called Maple which is a Computer Algebra System.

In my free time when I'm not doing school work, I like to ride my bike, listen to music, take photos, and go on roadtrips. 
I also like to travel when there isn't a global pandemic. 
When the pandemic is under control, I want to travel to Hawaii or The Bahamas.
